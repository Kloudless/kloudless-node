# Change Log

## TBD

* The response object is now returned in the callback.

## 1.0.1

* The multipart upload endpoints now correctly use `v1` instead of `v0`.

## 1.0.0

* The API version has been updated to `v1`. This introduces backwards
  incompatible changes. Please review the
  [migration guide](https://developers.kloudless.com/docs/v1/migration)
  for more information on migrating from `v0` to `v1`.
